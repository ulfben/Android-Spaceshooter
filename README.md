# Android-Spaceshooter
A "my first game"-type Android project. It is a simple side scrolling space shooter and demonstrates: 

- the basics of the layout system (the start menu)
- the basics of the resource system
- immersive full screen mode
- running a core game loop separate from the Android UI thread
- rendering to a SurfaceView (again, from a non-UI thread)
- basic touch events
- fixed height frame buffer, respecting screen aspect ratio
- fixed resolution and manual scaling of assets (eg: nodpi)
- simple Entity-hierarchy
- data persistence (SharedPreferences)

and probably a bunch of other stuff I can't remember atm.
